## Episode Overview

This episode features Dan Wong, author of "Breakneck: China's Quest to Engineer the Future," offering a unique perspective on US-China relations through his framework of an "engineering state" versus a "lawyerly society." Wong, who was born in China but raised in Canada and the US, spent six years working as an economic analyst in China, including during the entire COVID lockdown period. His central thesis argues that China is run by engineers focused on building infrastructure and solving problems, while America is dominated by lawyers skilled at blocking action through procedural obstacles. Wong sees striking similarities between Americans and Chineseâ€”both peoples display hastiness, willingness to take shortcuts, and future-oriented thinking that differs markedly from Europe's "mausoleum economy." However, he identifies crucial downsides to each approach: China's engineering mindset extends to "social engineering" that treats people as optimization problems (evident in policies like zero-COVID and treatment of ethnic minorities), while America's lawyerly culture excels at protecting existing interests but struggles to build new infrastructure or maintain manufacturing capabilities. Wong advocates for economists in government, viewing them as synthesizing the best of both approachesâ€”empirical like engineers but understanding dynamic social systems like lawyers. Despite China's authoritarian overreach, he argues America must learn from China's infrastructure-building capacity, while China could benefit from America's protection of individual rights.

## Key Sections

### Wong's Background and Return to China

This opening section establishes Wong's unique position as both insider and outsider observer of China. Having immigrated as a child, his return as an adult economic analyst provided him access to both formal government communications and informal street-level conversations.

- Born in China's Yunnan province in early 1990s, immigrated to Canada at age 7
- Parents were part of China's "luckiest generation" born in 1960s who experienced transition from planned to market economy
- Returned to China in 2017 as analyst for GaveKal Dragonomics focusing on "Made in China 2025" industrial policy
- Read official party publications and Xi Jinping speeches while traveling extensively across the country

> *"I found myself reading most major speeches by Xi Jinping that was published in the Party's main theory magazine. It's a magazine called Seeking Truth"* â€”**Dan Wong**

> *"Chinese everywhere including in the imperial center of Beijing have a very nice appreciation of the informalities of Chinese society. The most blasphemous things that one could hear would be among urban residents in Beijing even today who would tell you about all the ways that the central government is meddling with their lives"* â€”**Dan Wong**

**Why this matters:** Wong's bilingual access to both official and unofficial China provides credibility for his observations about the gap between state propaganda and citizen sentiment.

### The COVID Experience and Government Control

Building on his established presence in China, this section reveals how the pandemic lockdowns demonstrated both the engineering state's problem-solving capabilities and its authoritarian overreach, giving Wong firsthand insight into how China treats citizens as variables to be optimized.

- Stayed in China for three years (2020-2022) during zero-COVID without leaving the country
- Witnessed three phases: initial anger at government, appreciation for containment success, then exhaustion during Shanghai's 10-week lockdown of 25 million people
- Government banned his website in 2022, forcing consultation with Canadian Consul General about safety
- Observed the abrupt pivot from "zero COVID" to "total COVID" that led to massive death toll

> *"I was concerned at several points for my safety. At one point in 2022, the Chinese government banned my website within China"* â€”**Dan Wong**

> *"Control your soul's desire for freedom. Do not open the window or sing"* â€”**Drone announcement to Shanghai residents**

**Why this matters:** The COVID response exemplified Wong's thesis about China as an engineering state that treats society as an optimization problem, even at enormous human cost.

### Defining the Engineering State vs Lawyerly Society Framework

This section transitions from Wong's personal experience to his analytical framework, explaining how professional training shapes governmental approaches to problem-solving and revealing fundamental differences in how each system approaches building versus blocking.

- **Engineering State (China)**: Leadership dominated by engineers who build infrastructure, solve technical problems, but treat society as another engineering challenge
- At various points, all 9 members of China's top Politburo Standing Committee had engineering degrees
- Focus on mega-projects: dams, highways, high-speed rail, manufacturing capacity
- **Lawyerly Society (US)**: Government dominated by lawyers skilled at procedure, argumentation, and blocking action
- Biden White House had ~140 lawyers, 25% with Yale Law degrees
- Legal system enables endless litigation that delays infrastructure projects

> *"China is a country that is run by engineers while the US is a country run by lawyers. Engineers, he explains, are driven to build while lawyers are driven to argue and obstruct"* â€”**Stephen Dubner summarizing Wong**

> *"I think that no two peoples are more alike. They have a hastiness around them. They have a sense of being willing to take shortcuts, especially on health and wealth. They both have a sense of the future in a way that I think is not so apparent anymore in Europe or Japan"* â€”**Dan Wong**

**Why this matters:** This framework provides a fresh lens for understanding US-China competition beyond traditional ideological categories of democracy versus authoritarianism.

### The Downsides and Benefits of Each System

As a natural progression from defining the framework, this section examines the costs and benefits of each approach, showing how engineering states can become oppressive while lawyerly societies can become paralyzed.

- **Engineering State Problems**: Social engineering, ethnic minority persecution, treating humans as optimization variables (one-child policy, zero-COVID)
- Physical engineers "cannot restrain themselves from treating society as just another big optimization problem"
- **Lawyerly Society Problems**: Infrastructure decay, inability to build housing or transit, protecting existing wealth over innovation
- NYC spends $2 billion per mile of subway construction (8-9x more expensive than European cities)
- California high-speed rail: 20 years after voter approval, still not operational

> *"They are also fundamentally social engineers and the physical engineers cannot restrain themselves from treating society as just another big optimization problem"* â€”**Dan Wong**

> *"Lawyers block everything good and bad. So on one hand we don't have functional infrastructure almost anywhere in the US but we also don't have stupid ideas like the one child policy"* â€”**Dan Wong**

**Why this matters:** Understanding these tradeoffs helps explain why each system produces both impressive achievements and serious failures.

### Process Knowledge and Manufacturing Advantage

This section delves deeper into Wong's analysis of why China has gained manufacturing dominance, moving beyond simple labor cost explanations to examine the accumulation of practical expertise through hands-on experience.

- **Process Knowledge**: Tacit, experiential knowledge gained through actually making things, distinct from patents or equipment
- Chinese workers "solving seven problems a day before breakfast" builds expertise that enables innovation
- US invented solar cells (Bell Labs, 1954) but China now controls 90% of solar industry supply chain
- Manufacturing experience in one area (TVs, iPhones) transfers to adjacent technologies (drones, batteries)

> *"They've just been solving seven problems a day before breakfast because they have so many problems to solve"* â€”**Dan Wong**

> *"So if you don't master something like television production, then it becomes quite a lot more difficult to master other aspects of consumer electronics"* â€”**Dan Wong**

**Why this matters:** This explains why manufacturing reshoring is so difficultâ€”it's not just about building factories, but rebuilding decades of accumulated expertise.

## Top 5 Lessons Recap

1. **Professional training shapes governance**: Whether leaders are trained as engineers or lawyers fundamentally affects whether governments build or block projects.

2. **Process knowledge matters more than patents**: Manufacturing dominance comes from accumulated hands-on experience, not just intellectual property or equipment.

3. **Both systems have serious blindspots**: Engineering states treat people as optimization problems while lawyerly societies protect existing interests over innovation.

4. **Americans and Chinese are more similar than different**: Both cultures embrace risk-taking, shortcuts, and future-oriented thinking unlike Europe's focus on perfecting the past.

5. **Economists might govern better than either**: They combine engineers' empirical approach with lawyers' understanding of dynamic social systems.

## Reflection Questions

1. How might your own professional training (whether in law, engineering, business, or other fields) influence how you approach complex social problems?

2. What examples do you see in your community of either "engineering" solutions that ignore human complexity or "lawyerly" processes that prevent necessary progress?

3. If you had to choose, would you rather live under a system that builds impressive infrastructure but limits personal freedom, or one that protects individual rights but struggles to maintain basic services?
